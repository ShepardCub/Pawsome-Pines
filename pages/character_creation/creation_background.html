You're stronger and picked a few tricks from your previous life than the average Joe, but look rougher on the edges and might come accross as dull</p>

                    <p>Youth is meant to be enjoyed, and you followed that principle to its fullest. Party and clubs, you knew the best places in the city. You're a real social and know a few tricks from when you needed to find happy pills ,even tho you wondered if taking so much didn't fry some parts of your brain. That lifestyle wasn't free and you start with less money </p>
